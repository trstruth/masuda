[Junichi Masuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junichi_Masuda) is a Japanese video game composer, director, designer, producer, singer, programmer and trombonist, best known for his work in the Pok√©mon franchise. He is a member of the Game Freak board of directors, and has been employed at the company since 1989 when he founded it alongside Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori.

### Overview
In the pokemon games, many of the interactions in the game are decided by the output of a _pseudo-random number generator_, or pRNG.  For example, when the player encounters a pokemon, its stats are determined by the state of the pRNG.

In the generation 3 games (R/S/E/Fr/Lg), the game displays roughly 60 frames/second, and the state of the pRNG is said to be "advanced" every frame.  This means if the player knows
* the initial seed passed to the pRNG
* the mechanics behind how the pRNG is advanced
* how the numbers outputted by the pRNG are converted into pokemon stats

Then the user can find a frame which will produce a desireable pokemon, wait for the amount of time before the desired frame occurs, then encounter the desired pokemon.

masuda is a library written in rust which implements the behavior of the random number generator used in the pokemon games.  Specifically, it provides an implementation of a [linear congruential generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator) which produces a sequence of pseudo random numbers.

### Usage
Try running the examples to see it in action

`cargo run --example ten_frames` generates 10 frames and the pokemon generated on those frames

`cargo run --example is_shiny` finds the 3 earliest shiny frames and displays them

most usages of this lib will probably look something like this:
```rust
use masuda::generators::LinearCongruential;

...

// create an lcrng instance, pass a seed to the constructor
// in pokemon emerald, inital seed is always 0
// this variable needs to be `mut` because the rng stores some internal state
let mut rng = LinearCongruential::new(0);

// generate a pokemon using method 1
// each call to these methods advance the rng by one frame.
rng.method_1();
```
